# **ABSTRACT** : 
Dipping with communication is fundamentally a necessary key for a clear communication between the least , that is how our world of digital **Ex changeability** is evolving . Including in the web surface , many web-based services are including a strongly affirmative and user friendly User interface for the other end . as the *international Organization for Standardization* ( OSI ) and *World Wide Web Consortium* (W3C) standardized the accessibility of the web to all the users by a base-guideline called WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines). 

# **INTRODUCTION** :

# **RESEARCH METHOD** :
In this study we will put these guidelines to the test but conducting a full heuristic and an experimental evaluation on some giving websites , we will take our sample of study the official website of [The Higher Institution of Technology and communication study](https://www.isetcom.tn/public/home.faces) and [TEK-UP University official website](https://tek-up.de/) . 
For our research we will use two primary method , Heuristic and and Experimental  Evaluation to see how our samples will respond to the general standard guidelines (responsiveness , availability , design .. etc) 

# 1.1 **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines ( WCAG )** : 
// make intro for this 
[1] There are millions of people who have disabilities that affect their use of the Web. Web accessibility aims to help these people to perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with, as well as contribute to, the Web, and thereby the society in general. This accessibility is, in part, facilitated by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) currently moving from version one to two , 
These guidelines are intended to encourage designers to make sure their sites conform to specifications, and in that conformance enable the assistive technologies of disabled users to better interact with the page content . 
## 1.2 **HEURISTIC EVALUATION** : 
A **heuristic evaluation** is a method for identifying design flaws in a user interface. Evaluators judge the design against a set of guidelines (called heuristics) that make systems easy to use.
Heuristic evaluations are useful for identifying glaring problems in an interface. That interface can be just about anything that users will interact with including prototypes, physical products, [games](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-heuristics-applied-video-games/), [virtual reality](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-heuristics-virtual-reality/), or [voice interfaces.](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/voice-interfaces-assessing-the-potential/) The method can be particularly helpful early in the design process. Heuristic evaluations are **useful for stretching a limited UX research budget,** because they help you find likely issues without having to test with participants. 
However, **heuristic evaluations cannot replace user research**. User-experience design is [highly contextual](https://www.nngroup.com/videos/it-depends-ux-slogan-14/). To design good experiences, you’ll still need to test with actual users. But heuristic [evaluations can complement your team’s research](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-problems-found-by-heuristic-evaluation/) work; for example, conducting a heuristic evaluation in preparation for an upcoming usability test might help you identify the elements of the design that you should target during testing.

### 1.2.1 **Heuristic Criteria of Bastien and Scapin**  : 
Bastien and Scapin developed a set of ergonomic criteria for evaluating user interfaces. These criteria focus on usability aspects such as user guidance, workload, error management, and consistency. Their framework emphasizes the importance of designing interfaces that support users effectively while minimizing cognitive load and errors. The criteria are grouped into categories like guidance (e.g., feedback and prompts), workload reduction (e.g., minimizing redundant actions), error prevention, and adaptability to user needs[](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/heuristic-evaluation?srsltid=AfmBOopoQ-OhsZa0inKtx49jYnbP3SFdWftKJxndn86UeQk51-svKsPD)
### 12.2 **Heur Criteria of Nielson** : 
Jakob Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics are widely used for heuristic evaluations. These include principles such as:
- **:** Keeping users informed about what is happening.
- **:** Using familiar language and concepts.
- **:** Allowing users to undo actions easily.
- **:** Ensuring uniformity in design.
- **:** Designing systems to minimize errors.
- **:** Reducing memory load by making options visible.
- **:** Supporting both novice and expert users.
- **:** Avoiding unnecessary information.
- **:** Providing clear error messages.
## 1.3 **EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION** :
**Experimental evaluation** is a critical phase in scientific research that systematically assesses the validity, performance, and reliability of a proposed method, model, or hypothesis under controlled conditions. This process involves designing rigorous experiments to test predefined objectives, often comparing the proposed approach against established baselines or alternative solutions. Key steps include defining measurable metrics (e.g., accuracy, efficiency, error rates), selecting appropriate datasets or experimental setups, and ensuring reproducibility through detailed documentation of parameters, tools, and environmental conditions. Statistical analyses, such as hypothesis testing or confidence intervals, are employed to quantify significance and mitigate random variability. Limitations, biases, and external factors that may influence outcomes are carefully acknowledged to contextualize results. By objectively validating theoretical claims with empirical evidence, experimental evaluation not only strengthens the credibility of the research but also provides actionable insights for future refinement or real-world application.

# METHODOLOGY : 

## 1. Study Design

We will conduct an **in-depth experimental evaluation of a single site**. This approach allows us to thoroughly investigate user behavior and identify usability issues specific to one platform, providing detailed insights for potential improvements. We have selected **[The Higher Institution of Technology and communication study](https://www.isetcom.tn/public/home.faces)** for this evaluation.
## 2. Participants
We will recruit two distinct user groups:
- **Expert Users**: Participants with significant experience in purchasing cultural or multimedia products online (defined as making such purchases at least once a month for the past year). We will ensure that these users are not intimately familiar with the ISETCOM website to avoid bias.
- **First-Time Users**: Participants with good internet skills but limited experience in online purchases (defined as having made fewer than three online purchases in the past year).

We will observe at least two users from each group (expert and first-time) for a total of four participants.
## 3. Task Scenarios

We will develop four task scenarios that reflect common user goals when interacting with the ISETCOM website:

1. **Find a specific course**: Locate the "Licence Appliquée en Technologies de l'Informatique" course using the website's navigation or search functionality.
2. **Locate the international partnerships section**: Find the section of the website that describes ISETCOM's international partnerships.
3. **Find the contact information**: Locate the contact information for the university, including the phone number and email address.
4. **Find the registration information**: Find information about how to register for the courses offered at the university.

These scenarios are designed to assess various aspects of the website's usability, including navigation, search functionality, and information architecture.
## 4. Evaluation Procedure

The evaluation will be conducted as follows:

1. **Pilot Test**: We will conduct a pilot test with one participant to refine the task scenarios and evaluation script.
2. **Informed Consent**: Participants will be informed about the study's purpose and procedure and will provide informed consent before participating.
3. **Task Completion**: Participants will be asked to complete each task scenario while using the think-aloud protocol, verbalizing their thoughts and actions as they navigate the website.
4. **Post-Task Questionnaire**: After completing each task, participants will answer a short questionnaire assessing their perceived ease of use, satisfaction, and any difficulties encountered.
5. **System Usability Scale (SUS)**: After completing all tasks, participants will complete the SUS questionnaire to provide an overall rating of the website's usability.

## 5. Data Collection
We will collect the following data:
- **Observation**: We will observe and record user behavior, including time on task, navigation paths, errors, and expressions of frustration.
- **Think-Aloud Protocols**: We will record the audio of participants' think-aloud protocols for later analysis.
- **Questionnaire Responses**: We will collect and analyze responses from the post-task questionnaires and the SUS.
    
## 6. Data Analysis

We will analyze the collected data using both quantitative and qualitative methods:

- **Quantitative Analysis**: We will calculate descriptive statistics (e.g., mean time on task, error rates, SUS scores) to quantify user performance and satisfaction.
- **Qualitative Analysis**: We will perform thematic analysis of the think-aloud protocols and open-ended questionnaire responses to identify recurring usability issues and patterns in user behavior.
- **Ergonomic Principles**: We will relate the identified usability issues to recognized ergonomic principles and concepts, such as Nielsen's heuristics and Bastien and Scapin's criteria.
