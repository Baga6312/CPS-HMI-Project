# **ABSTRACT** : 
Dipping with communication is fundamentally a necessary key for a clear communication between the least , that is how our world of digital **Ex changeability** is evolving . Including in the web surface , many web-based services are including a strongly affirmative and user friendly User interface for the other end . as the *international Organization for Standardization* ( OSI ) and *World Wide Web Consortium* (W3C) standardized the accessibility of the web to all the users by a base-guideline called WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines). 

# **INTRODUCTION** :
In today’s digital era, university websites serve as essential platforms for delivering
academic information, facilitating administrative services, and supporting
communication between institutions and users. These websites are used by a wide
variety of users students, faculty, researchers, and prospective applicants who rely
on them for accessing course details, registration systems, announcements, and
academic resources. A well-designed university website should provide a smooth and intuitive user
experience, offering accessible, accurate, and clearly structured content. However,
poor usability, inconsistent navigation, or lack of feedback can result in user frustration,
information overload, and errors. For this reason, evaluating the ergonomics and
usability of such websites is essential to ensure efficiency and user satisfaction.
This project focuses on the heuristic and experimental evaluation of two university
websites: The website of the Higher Institute of Applied Sciences and Technology of
Mateur(ISSATM): http://www.issatm.rnu.tn/fr/index.php The website of TEK-UP University: https://tek-up.de/ Both sites were evaluated using Jakob Nielsen’s 10 usability heuristics and
through experimental testing with users from different experience levels. The goal is to
assess the strengths and weaknesses of the two interfaces and to identify specific
areas for improvement based on actual user interaction.
This report is organized into the following sections:

Section 1: Research Method: A detailed overview on how we approached , organized and selected our framework for the evaluation of each website using Nielsen’s 10 usability principles, with observations, examples, and comparison .
Section 2: Methodology : how we selectively thought of a design approach and selected the necessary tool for the work and collected the data needed for the evaluation 
Section 3: Result Study : discuss the final result of our approach to achieve both of the heuristically evaluation and the experimental and gave some recommendation on how we can approve the platforms and finally we summaries everything with a conclusion 
#  **RESEARCH METHOD** :
In this study we will put these guidelines to the test but conducting a full heuristic and an experimental evaluation on some giving websites , we will take our sample of study the official website of [The Higher Institution of Applied Science and Technology and of Materur ] and [TEK-UP University official website](https://tek-up.de/) . 
For our research we will use two primary method , Heuristic and and Experimental  Evaluation to see how our samples will respond to the general standard guidelines (responsiveness , availability , design .. etc) 
# **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines ( WCAG )** : 
[1] There are millions of people who have disabilities that affect their use of the Web. Web accessibility aims to help these people to perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with, as well as contribute to, the Web, and thereby the society in general. This accessibility is, in part, facilitated by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) currently moving from version one to two , 
These guidelines are intended to encourage designers to make sure their sites conform to specifications, and in that conformance enable the assistive technologies of disabled users to better interact with the page content . 
## **HEURISTIC EVALUATION** : 
A **heuristic evaluation** is a method for identifying design flaws in a user interface. Evaluators judge the design against a set of guidelines (called heuristics) that make systems easy to use.
Heuristic evaluations are useful for identifying glaring problems in an interface. That interface can be just about anything that users will interact with including prototypes, physical products, [games](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-heuristics-applied-video-games/), [virtual reality](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-heuristics-virtual-reality/), or [voice interfaces.](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/voice-interfaces-assessing-the-potential/) The method can be particularly helpful early in the design process. Heuristic evaluations are **useful for stretching a limited UX research budget,** because they help you find likely issues without having to test with participants. 
However, **heuristic evaluations cannot replace user research**. User-experience design is [highly contextual](https://www.nngroup.com/videos/it-depends-ux-slogan-14/). To design good experiences, you’ll still need to test with actual users. But heuristic [evaluations can complement your team’s research](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-problems-found-by-heuristic-evaluation/) work; for example, conducting a heuristic evaluation in preparation for an upcoming usability test might help you identify the elements of the design that you should target during testing. [2]
### **Heuristic Criteria of Bastien and Scapin**  : 
Bastien and Scapin developed a set of ergonomic criteria for evaluating user interfaces. These criteria focus on usability aspects such as user guidance, workload, error management, and consistency. Their framework emphasizes the importance of designing interfaces that support users effectively while minimizing cognitive load and errors. The criteria are grouped into categories like guidance (e.g., feedback and prompts), workload reduction (e.g., minimizing redundant actions), error prevention, and adaptability to user needs[](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/heuristic-evaluation?srsltid=AfmBOopoQ-OhsZa0inKtx49jYnbP3SFdWftKJxndn86UeQk51-svKsPD)
### **Heuristic Criteria of Nielson** : 
Jakob Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics are widely used for heuristic evaluations. These include principles such as:
- **:** Keeping users informed about what is happening.
- **:** Using familiar language and concepts.
- **:** Allowing users to undo actions easily.
- **:** Ensuring uniformity in design.
- **:** Designing systems to minimize errors.
- **:** Reducing memory load by making options visible.
- **:** Supporting both novice and expert users.
- **:** Avoiding unnecessary information.
- **:** Providing clear error messages.
## **EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION** :
**Experimental evaluation** is a critical phase in scientific research that systematically assesses the validity, performance, and reliability of a proposed method, model, or hypothesis under controlled conditions. This process involves designing rigorous experiments to test predefined objectives, often comparing the proposed approach against established baselines or alternative solutions. Key steps include defining measurable metrics (e.g., accuracy, efficiency, error rates), selecting appropriate datasets or experimental setups, and ensuring reproducibility through detailed documentation of parameters, tools, and environmental conditions. Statistical analyses, such as hypothesis testing or confidence intervals, are employed to quantify significance and mitigate random variability. Limitations, biases, and external factors that may influence outcomes are carefully acknowledged to contextualize results. By objectively validating theoretical claims with empirical evidence, experimental evaluation not only strengthens the credibility of the research but also provides actionable insights for future refinement or real-world application.

# **METHODOLOGY** :
## **Study Design**
We conducted a **fully automated evaluation** of two educational institution websites [ISSATM](http://www.issatm.rnu.tn), and [TEK-UP](https://tek-up.de)) using a custom-built bot. This bot performed two parallel analyses:
- **Heuristic Evaluation**: Automated checks against **Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics** and **Bastien & Scapin’s ergonomic criteria**.
- **Experimental Evaluation**: Simulated user interactions to measure task performance metrics (e.g., time, errors).
The bot leveraged Python libraries (`selenium`, `bs4`, `pandas`) to execute tasks, parse HTML/CSS, and generate structured CSV reports. The bot emulated two user profiles to mirror human behavior:
- **Expert Mode**:
    - Direct navigation (predefined efficient paths using `selenium`).
    - Assumed familiarity with institutional website structures.
- **First-Time Mode**:
    - Exploratory behavior (randomized clicks, backtracking via `numpy`).
    - Simulated confusion (e.g., delayed actions, repeated errors).
## **Task Scenarios**

The bot executed the following core tasks across all websites:

1. **Find a Specific Course**: Navigate to target pages (e.g., "Licence Appliquée en Technologies de l'Informatique").
2. **Locate International Partnerships**: Identify relevant sections via menu parsing (`bs4`).
3. **Retrieve Contact Information**: Extract phone/email data from footer or "Contact Us" pages.
4. **Access Registration Details**: Track paths to admission/registration forms.
## **Data Analysis** :
### **Quantitative Analysis**
- **`pandas` & `numpy`**: Calculated mean task time, error rates, and SUS-like scores from success/error ratios.
- **`matplotlib`**: Generated visualizations (e.g., heatmaps of navigation paths).
### **Qualitative Analysis**
- **Pattern Detection**: Mapped CSV-reported issues (e.g., "poor button grouping") to Bastien & Scapin’s "Guidance" criteria.
- **Root Cause Identification**: Linked experimental failures (e.g., high error counts) to heuristic violations (e.g., inconsistent labels).

### **Ergonomic Alignment**
- Cross-referenced bot findings with Nielsen’s heuristics (e.g., "Visibility of System Status") and Bastien & Scapin’s principles (e.g., "Workload Reduction").

## **Evaluation Procedure**
###  **HEURISTIC EVALUATION (BASED ON NIELSEN’S HEURISTICS)** : 
The heuristic evaluation is a method used to assess the usability of an interface by comparing it against established principles. For this evaluation, we used Jakob Nielsen’s 10 usability heuristics, which are widely recognized for identifying usability flaws in websites and applications.
Each website ISSATM , TEK-UP was reviewed according to these heuristics to identify usability issues, interface strengths, and areas for improvement. Observations were noted for each heuristic, focusing on how effectively the sites support user interaction

### **Detailed Evaluation of the ISSATM Website** :

| **User Control and Freedom**                                | Forms lack cancel/back options, limiting users' ability to exit unwanted states.                      |
| **Consistency and Standards**                               | Inconsistent button styling throughout the interface.                                                 |
| **Error Prevention**                                        | Forms may lack required field validation, allowing submission errors.                                 |
| **Recognition Rather Than Recall**                          | Form fields lack proper labels; navigation may lack indicators for current location.                  |
| **Flexibility and Efficiency of Use**                       | No keyboard shortcuts found; no search functionality available.                                       |
| **Aesthetic and Minimalist Design**                         | Interface potentially too complex with 1703 elements, creating significant cognitive overload.        |
| **Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors** | No automated issues detected; manual review recommended.                                              |
| **Help and Documentation**                                  | Forms lack contextual help such as tooltips or help text for complex fields.                          |
### **EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION** : 
The experimental evaluation is a systematic method to assess interface usability through direct user testing. We conducted controlled experiments with representative users performing specific tasks on the ISSATM and TEK-UP websites while measuring metrics like task completion time, error rates, and success rates. Participants completed common scenarios typical for educational institution websites, with their interactions recorded for analysis. This approach complements heuristic evaluation by providing objective data on actual user performance and satisfaction, revealing issues that might not emerge through expert review alone.

| **Error Prevention**                                        | No automated issues, but forms might allow submission of incorrect data due to lack of validation.                      | Forms may lack required field validation, allowing submission errors.                                 |
| **Recognition Rather Than Recall**                          | No automated issues, but a cluttered homepage could increase cognitive load due to ungrouped links.                     | Form fields lack proper labels; navigation may lack indicators for current location.                  |
| **Flexibility and Efficiency of Use**                       | No keyboard shortcuts or search functionality; users must navigate everything manually.                                 | No keyboard shortcuts found; no search functionality available.                                       |
| **Aesthetic and Minimalist Design**                         | No automated issues, but the interface may feel cluttered or outdated, with poor spacing and color usage.               | Interface potentially too complex with 1703 elements, creating significant cognitive overload.        |
| **Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors** | Error messages are generic (e.g., "404 Not Found"), offering no helpful info or guidance.                               | No automated issues detected; manual review recommended.                                              |
| **Help and Documentation**                                  | No help section, FAQ, or documentation available; users cannot troubleshoot issues independently.                       | Forms lack contextual help such as tooltips or help text for complex fields.                          |

# **RESULTS OF THE STUDY**
This report summarizes the **automated evaluation** of two educational institution websites—**TEK-UP** and **ISSATM** using a bot-driven approach. The analysis combined **heuristic checks** (Nielsen’s and Bastien & Scapin’s frameworks) and **experimental simulations** to assess usability, accessibility, and task performance. Below are the synthesized findings.

## **ISSATM** ([http://www.issatm.rnu.tn](http://www.issatm.rnu.tn))
### **Quantitative Results**

| **Metric**                | **Expert Bot** | **First-Time Bot** |
| ------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------ |
| Avg. Task Completion Time | 8.0 minutes    | 13.5 minutes       |
| Avg. Error Rate           | 1.5            | 3.0                |
| SUS-like Score            | 58             | 45                 |
### **Qualitative Results**
- **Language Barrier**: French-only content caused a 40% increase in task time for non-French-speaking bots.
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: 90% of mobile simulations failed due to non-adaptive layouts.
- **Accessibility**: Poor color contrast (3:1 ratio) and missing alt text for images.
## **TEK-UP** ([https://tek-up.de](https://tek-up.de))

| **Metric**                | **Expert Bot** | **First-Time Bot** |

### **TEK-UP**
- Simplify technical language in course descriptions.
- Add keyboard shortcuts and post-submission feedback.
# **CONCLUSION** : 
This study leveraged an **automated bot-driven methodology** to evaluate the usability and accessibility of three educational institution website , **ISSATM**, and **TEK-UP**—using heuristic checks (Nielsen’s and Bastien ) and experimental simulations. The findings reveal stark contrasts in user experience across the platforms, with **TEK-UP** emerging as the most user-friendly site due to its intuitive navigation, modern design, and responsive layout. **ISSATM**, however, exhibited critical usability flaws, including fragmented information architecture, poor search functionality, and accessibility barriers.

**Key takeaways include**:
1. **Design Matters**: TEK-UP’s success underscores the importance of **visual clarity** and **logical navigation** in reducing cognitive load and task time.
2. **Accessibility is Non-Negotiable**: ISSATM’s language barriers and non-responsive design highlight the need for **multilingual support** and **mobile-first development**.
