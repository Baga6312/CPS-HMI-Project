# Evaluate Websites
for the human interaction machine course we were tasked to evaluate a specific [basesdelacuisine](https://www.basesdelacuisine.com/) website to see if its ergonomics design reply to its demands from the user buy responding to some major questions   

the website is mainly about cooking , providing a range of techniques and recopies in form of images and videos , targeting a set of user who r looking for learning 
#### **A. Is it easy to use?**
Generally the website is straightforward , simple and enough for the user to get wat he wanted,  
- Can users find what they need quickly?
	--> yes , upon accessing the domain the first page will give us a list of headline , each headline contain a list of element of what the headline , descriptive generally 

- Are menus/logos clear?
	-->  the menu doesnt see to have a traditional structure of wat we call a menu today , the logo seems to be a bit pixelated 
	
- Do buttons/links work as expected?
	--> yes , most of the links are accessible , no overload on the system to do some delay wat will render the website in constant serve 

#### **B. Does it look comfortable?**
The User Interface design is a bit old , not something fancy with wat we expected our technology can do today ,  its not responsive to certain resolutions 

- Is text easy to read (font size, contrast)?
	--> the font of the text made it easy to read but colors are not in match , some italic form are not clear , some bold text also is unclear 

- Are colors calming or distracting?
	--> the websites uses 4 major colors ( green , yellow , blue and red ) from hard color to tan one , very unclear to what to decide if the colors are calming or  distracting 

-  Is there too much clutter? 
	--> yes , fucking ADS 
#### **C. Is it accessible?**

- Can people with disabilities use it?
	--> If we are talking about all the people with disability , sure thing is that all of them are not capable of using it , lets take a less critical case , for example a color blind person . will the color choice effect the readability and usage of the website ?? yes absolutely 

- Example: Can you navigate with a keyboard? Do images have descriptions?
	--> For people that does not have the proper resource to navigate the internet , so its some it is considered a part of the process where we see if the user is able to use only the keyboard to navigate the website . in our case ? yes  , the user is able to navigate the website without using the mouse by doing the default keybinding for navigation . 
### **D. Does it reduce "work" for users?**
--> the user is going to put so much work and effort to achieve his goal .

# Conclusion 
- summarizing what we ended up in this review of the website ,  the website does not approve to be able to contain the minimum features for an ordinary user to navigate , even for special users .
